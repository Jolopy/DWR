        <!--chest-->
        <item>1) Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.
\n\n3) After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\n5) When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
</item>
        <item>1) Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
\n\n2) Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
\n\n3) Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
\n\n5) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.
</item>
        <item>1) Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training.
\n\n2) Lay on the bench with your feet flat on the ground, driving through to your hips. Your back should be arched, and your shoulder blades retracted.
\n\n3) Take a medium, pronated grip covering the rings on the bar. Remove the bar from the rack, holding the weight above your chest with your arms extended. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Lower the bar to the sternum by flexing the elbows. Maintain control and do not bounce the bar off of your chest. Your lats should stay tight and elbows slightly drawn in.
\n\n5) After touching your torso with the bar, extend the elbows to return the bar to the starting position.
</item>
        <item>1) Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.
\n\n2) Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.
\n\n3) Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest.
\n\n5) Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them.
\n\n6) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\n7) When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.
</item>
        <item>1) To get into the starting position, hold your body at arms length with your arms nearly locked above the bars.
\n\n2) Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.
\n\n3) Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Position two cables at chest height and attach a handle.
\n\n2) Reach across your body and grab one handle with a neutral grip. Repeat for the opposite arm.
\n\n3) Position the arms straight ahead holding onto each handle and keep a soft bend in the knees.
\n\n4) Keep the elbows slightly bent and pull the handles laterally without squeezing the shoulder blades together excessively.
\n\n5) Slowly lower the handles back to the starting position under control.
\n\n6) Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Place a dumbbell standing up on a flat bench.
\n\n2) Ensuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench (torso across it as in forming a cross) with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.
\n\n3) Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.
\n\n4) While keeping your arms locked in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.
\n\n5) At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.
\n\n6) Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Set both pulleys directly at (or slightly above) shoulder height and select the desired weight.
\n\n2) Grasp both handles with a neutral grip and take a step forward to split the stance.
\n\n3) Press the handles to lockout while flexing the pecs and extending the elbows.
\n\n4) Keep a slight bend in the elbows, move entirely at the shoulder joint, and slowly allow the arms to open while the pecs stretch.
\n\n5) Return to the starting position by flexing your pecs and bringing the handles together at chest height.
\n\n6) Slowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
</item>



        <!--biceps-->
        <item>1) Seat yourself on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand. You should pressed firmly against he back with your feet together. Allow the dumbbells to hang straight down at your side, holding them with a neutral grip. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Initiate the movement by flexing at the elbow, attempting to keep the upper arm stationary.
\n\n3)Continue to the top of the movement and pause, then slowly return to the start position.
</item>
        <item>1) Hold a dumbbell in each hand and lie back on an incline bench.
\n\n2) The dumbbells should be at arms length hanging at your sides and your palms should be facing out. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) Now as you exhale curl the weight outward and up while keeping your forearms in line with your side deltoids. Continue the curl until the dumbbells are at shoulder height and to the sides of your deltoids. Tip:The end of the movement should look similar to a double biceps pose.
\n\n4) After a second contraction at the top of the movement, start to inhale and slowly lower the weights back to the starting position using the same path used to bring them up.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.
\n\n2) Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
\n\n4) Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.
</item>
        <item>1) Stand up straight while holding an EZ curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hands should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps. Focus on only moving your forearms.
\n\n3) Continue to raise the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the top contracted position for a moment and squeeze the biceps.
\n\n4) Then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) The wide grip barbell curl is a good exercise for training the inner part of the biceps. Grasp a barbell with your hands at a wider than shoulder width, using an underhand grip (palms facing up).
\n\n2) Your feet should be firmly on the floor, about should width apart. If you prefer, you can place one foot back. This is the starting position.
\n\n3) Keeping your body fixed (do not swing!), slowly curl the weight up as far as possible.
\n\n4) Squeeze the biceps, and then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.
\n\n5) Repeat for desired reps.
</item>
        <item>1) Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at shoulder width with the elbows close to the torso. The palm of your hands should be facing down (pronated grip). This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle.
\n\n3) Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.
\n\n4) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arms length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
\n\n3) Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
\n\n4) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.
\n\n2) The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) Now, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps.

        <!--triceps-->
        <item>1) Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.
\n\n3) After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
\n\n5) When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.
</item>
        <item>1) To get into the starting position, hold your body at arms length with your arms nearly locked above the bars.
\n\n2) Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.
\n\n3) Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
</item>

\n\n3) Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling.
\n\n4) Repeat.
</item>
        <item>1) Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
\n\n2) Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position.
\n\n3) Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.
\n\n4) After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Attach a rope to a low pulley. After selecting an appropriate weight, grasp the rope with both hands and face away from the cable.
\n\n2) osition your hands behind your head with your elbows point straight up. Your elbows should start out flexed, and you can stagger your stance and lean gently away from the machine to create greater stability. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) To perform the movement, extend through the elbow while keeping the upper arm in position, raising your hands above your head.
\n\n4) Squeeze your triceps at the top of the movement, and slowly lower the weight back to the start position.
</item>
        <item>1) Start with a dumbbell in each hand and your palms facing your torso. Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knees and bend forward at the waist. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.
\n\n2) Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.
\n\n3) After a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.
\n\n2) The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) Keeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\n4) Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Grab a dumbbell and either sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs or stand up straight.
\n\n2) Clean the dumbbell up to bring it to shoulder height and then extend the arm over your head so that the whole arm is perpendicular to the floor and next to your head. The dumbbell should be on top of you. The other hand can be kept fully extended to the side, by the waist, supporting the upper arm that has the dumbbell or grabbing a fixed surface.
\n\n3) Rotate the wrist so that the palm of your hand is facing forward and the pinkie is facing the ceiling. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head as you hold the upper arm stationary. Inhale as you perform this movement and pause when your triceps are fully stretched.
\n\n5) Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps as you breathe out. Tip: It is imperative that only the forearm moves. The upper arm should remain at all times stationary next to your head.
\n\n6) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.
</item>

        <item>1) Hang from a chin-up bar with both arms extended at arms length in top of you using either a wide grip or a medium grip. The legs should be straight down with the pelvis rolled slightly backwards. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Raise your legs until the torso makes a 90-degree angle with the legs. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so.
\n\n3) Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in.
\n\n4) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Select a light resistance and sit down on the ab machine placing your feet under the pads provided and grabbing the top handles. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you rest the triceps on the pads provided. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) At the same time, begin to lift the legs up as you crunch your upper torso. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion. Concentrate on using your abs to move the weight while relaxing your legs and feet.
\n\n3) After a second pause, slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions
</item>
        <item>1) Connect a standard handle to a tower, andâ€”if possibleâ€”position the cable to shoulder height. If not, a low pulley will suffice.
\n\n2) With your side to the cable, grab the handle with both hands and step away from the tower. You should be approximately armâ€™s length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable.
\n\n3) With your feet positioned hip-width apart and knees slightly bent, hold the cable to the middle of your chest. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Press the cable away from your chest, fully extending both arms. You core should be tight and engaged.
\n\n5) Hold the repetition for several seconds before returning to the starting position.
\n\n6) At the conclusion of the set, repeat facing the other direction.
</item>
        <item>1) Kneel below a high pulley that contains a rope attachment.
\n\n2) Grasp cable rope attachment and lower the rope until your hands are placed next to your face.
\n\n3) Flex your hips slightly and allow the weight to hyperextend the lower back. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) With the hips stationary, flex the waist as you contract the abs so that the elbows travel towards the middle of the thighs. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction for a second.
\n\n5) Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Make sure that you keep constant tension on the abs throughout the movement. Also, do not choose a weight so heavy that the lower back handles the brunt of the work.
\n\n6) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.
\n\n2) Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you perpendicular to your torso and with the hands clasped. This is the starting position.
\n\n3) Twist your torso to the right side until your arms are parallel with the floor while breathing out.
\n\n4) Hold the contraction for a second and move back to the starting position while breathing out. Now move to the opposite side performing the same techniques you applied to the right side.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Hold the Ab Roller with both hands and kneel on the floor.
\n\n2) Now place the ab roller on the floor in front of you so that you are on all your hands and knees (as in a kneeling push up position). This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) Slowly roll the ab roller straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.
\n\n4) After a pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times.
</item>
        <item>1) Plant the hands directly under the shoulders (slightly wider than shoulder-width apart) like you’re about to do a push-up.
\n\n2) Ground the toes into the floor and squeeze the glutes to stabilize the body. Your legs should be working in the move too; careful not to lock or hyperextend your knees.
\n\n3) Neutralize the neck and spine by looking at a spot on the floor about a foot beyond the hands. Your head should be in line with your back.
\n\n4) Hold the position for 20 seconds. As you get more comfortable with the move, hold your plank for as long as possible without compromising form or breath.
</item>
        <item>1) Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground, or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. If you are resting your feet on a bench, place them three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch.
\n\n2) Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Dont lock your fingers behind your head.
\n\n3) While pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor.
\n\n4) Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - dont cheat yourself by using momentum.
\n\n5) After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.
\n\n6) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>

        <!--Back-->
        <item>1) Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip.
\n\n2) With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.
\n\n3) After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.
\n\n4) Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.
</item>
        <item>1) Take a wide grip on a pull-up bar, hanging freely with your arms extended. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Pull yourself up by flexing the elbows and adducting the glenohumeral joint. Do not swing or use momentum to complete the movement. Attempt to get your chin above your hands.
\n\n3) Pause at the top of the motion before lowering yourself to the starting position.
</item>
        <item>1) Position a bar into a landmine or in a corner to keep it from moving. Load an appropriate weight onto your end.
\n\n2) Stand over the bar, and position a Double D row handle around the bar next to the collar. Using your hips and legs, rise to a standing position.
\n\n3) Assume a wide stance with your hips back and your chest up. Your arms should be extended. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Pull the weight to your upper abdomen by retracting the shoulder blades and flexing the elbows. Do not jerk the weight or cheat during the movement.
\n\n5) After a brief pause, return to the starting position.
</item>
        <item>1) For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.
\n\n2) Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.
\n\n3) With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.
\n\n4) Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
\n\n2) Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
\n\n3) As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
\n\n4) As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip:Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.
\n\n5) After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
\n\n6) Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it.
\n\n2) Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support.
\n\n3) Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
\n\n4) Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms.
\n\n5) Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step.
\n\n6) Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.
\n\n7) Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.
</item>
        <item>1) Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads.
\n\n2) Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction.
\n\n3) With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.
\n\n4) Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.
\n\n5) Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.
\n\n6) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
\n\n2) Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.
\n\n3) As you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
\n\n4) As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip:Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary (only the arms should move). The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull the bar down using the forearms.
\n\n5) After a second in the contracted position, while squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.
\n\n6) Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
</item>

        <!--Legs-->
        <item>1) Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.
\n\n2) Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.
\n\n3) Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.
</item>
        <item>1) This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.
\n\n2) Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
\n\n3) Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
\n\n4) Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
\n\n5) Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
\n\n6) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).
\n\n2) Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
\n\n4) Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.
</item>
        <item>1) Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground.
\n\n3) Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.
\n\n4) Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.
</item>
        <item>1) Adjust the padded lever of the calf raise machine to fit your height.
\n\n2) Place your shoulders under the pads provided and position your toes facing forward (or using any of the two other positions described at the beginning of the chapter). The balls of your feet should be secured on top of the calf block with the heels extending off it. Push the lever up by extending your hips and knees until your torso is standing erect. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
\n\n4) Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.
\n\n2) Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
\n\n3) Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).
\n\n4) Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.
\n\n5) Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
\n\n6) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and sit on the machine with your back against the back support pad.
\n\n2) Place the back of lower leg on top of padded lever (just a few inches under the calves) and secure the lap pad against your thighs, just above the knees. Then grasp the side handles on the machine as you point your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances) and ensure that the legs are fully straight right in front of you. This will be your starting position.
\n\n3) As you exhale, pull the machine lever as far as possible to the back of your thighs by flexing at the knees. Keep your torso stationary at all times. Hold the contracted position for a second.
\n\n4) Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.
\n\n5) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>
        <item>1) Begin standing with your feet about hip-width apart and holding dumbbells in your hands down by your side. This will be your starting position.
\n\n2) Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should be in line with your front foot. Do not allow your front knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint.
\n\n3) Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up.
\n\n4) Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.
</item>
        <item>1) Begin seated on the ground with a bench directly behind you. Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise.
\n\n2) Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it.
\n\n3) Begin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet. Extend as far as possible, then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
</item>
        <item>1) For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.
\n\n2) Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.
\n\n3) Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.
\n\n4) Repeat for the recommended amount of times.
</item>
        <item>1) To begin, sit down on the abductor machine and select a weight you are comfortable with. When your legs are positioned properly, grip the handles on each side. Your entire upper body (from the waist up) should be stationary. This is the starting position.
\n\n2) Slowly press against the machine with your legs to move them away from each other while exhaling.
\n\n3) Feel the contraction for a second and begin to move your legs back to the starting position while breathing in. Note: Remember to keep your upper body stationary to prevent any injuries from occurring.
\n\n4) Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
</item>

        <!--Cardio-->
        <item>1) To begin, step onto the elliptical and select the desired option from the menu. Most ellipticals have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.
\n\n2) The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.
</item>
        <item>1) Do a posture check
\n\n2) Relax Your hands and Arms
\n\n3) Lean from your ankles
\n\n4) Push Forward from your Feet
\n\n5) Focus on Cadence
</item>
        <item>1) Rest your hands - or better yet, your fingertips - lightly on the bar in front of you or on the side rails.
\n\n2) Stand upright with a slight forward lean at the hips
\n\n3) Taken even, moderately deep steps.
\n\n4) Keep your entire foot on the pedal
</item>
        <item>1) When you jump, keep your arms relaxed and slightly bent, and keep your upper-body movements to a minimum. Your feet should barely clear the floor, and you should bend your knees just slightly.
\n\n2) Instead of turning your arms in big circles, simply let your wrists swivel slightly. (This is especially important when using a heavy rope; otherwise, you’re in for sore shoulders.)
\n\n3) Start with a few short sets — about 30 jumps for a light rope, 5 to 10 turns for a heavy rope. Rest by marching in place between sets.
\n\n4) Gradually increase the number of sets and jumps per set while decreasing the time you spend marching. Eventually, you’ll be able to jump 10 minutes or more continuously (probably less with a heavy rope). Humming the theme song from Rocky helps.</item>

</item>
        <item>1) Find a pace/resistance that allows you to work at the suggested rate of perceived exertion (RPE) on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (extremely hard). RPE is how hard it feels to work at the level of resistance youve chosen. If it feels too hard, back off on the resistance and speed. If its too easy, increase the resistance.
\n\n2) Your legs may get tired quickly if youre not used to the bike. It takes time to build endurance, so go as long as you can and stop when you are ready. You can add a little time to each workout to slowly build strength and endurance. You can even stop and stretch your legs if needed.
\n\n3) Perform this workout about three times a week with a day of rest in between.
\n\n4) Progress by adding a few minutes each time you workout until youre up to 30 minutes.
\n\n5) Stretch your lower body after your workout.
</item>
        <item>1) Start with treading water and getting comfortable in the water.
\n\n2) Try some laps and get comfortable with the kickboard.
\n\n3) Master breathing techniques (probably the most challenging part of swimming) with the kickboard. Breathing in the water is different from breathing on land. While swimming you have to get comfortable with your face in the water and develop a rhythm to you breathing. You exhale with your face in the water and inhale as you turn your head or pop up your head (depending on the stroke) to breathe.
\n\n4) Learn the strokes.
</item>
        <item>1) To begin, seat yourself on the rower. Make sure that your heels are resting comfortably against the base of the foot pedals and that the straps are secured. Select the program that you wish to use, if applicable. Sit up straight and bend forward at the hips.
\n\n2) There are three phases of movement when using a rower. The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles.
\n\n3) The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.
</item>
        <item>1) It starts with a work:rest ratio of 1:4 in Phase 1 for a total workout time of just under 15 minutes.
\n\n2) Phase 2 bumps up the amount of time in the "work" phase, bringing the ratio up to 1:2 and the total workout time to 17 minutes.
\n\n3) In Phase 3, the rest ratio is cut in half, bringing the ratio up to 1:1. The total workout time increases to 17 minutes.
\n\n4) Finally, in Phase 4, the rest ratio is cut in half again, raising the ratio to 2:1 and the total time at 20 minutes.
</item>
        <item>1) When you have decided on a location, warm up by speed walking or jogging for about three minutes on your chosen route. If you are an incline sprinter, you can jog in place for three minutes before doing some dynamic stretches. Then, start sprinting uphill.
\n\n2) Your sprint time will be determined by how long you have been sprint training. Beginners usually sprint in 30-second increments. Seasoned sprinters usually sprint for 180 seconds (two and a half minutes per sprint).
</item>
        <item>1) Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart. If you’re right-handed, take one step back with right foot (left-handers will do the opposite) so that lead (in this case, left) toe is in line with rear (right) heel. Turn left (lead) shoulder to opponent or bag. Bend knees slightly for agility. This stagger stance helps you maintain balance, allows you to use your hips for power when throwing a punch, and in a real match, makes you a smaller target for your opponent, giving them less area to connect a hit. Tuck chin and place gloves up to cheekbones to protect face.
